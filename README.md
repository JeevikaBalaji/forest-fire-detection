## Introduction

The **Forest Fire Detection** project aims to predict the likelihood of a forest fire based on various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. Early detection of forest fires is critical to minimize damage and enhance disaster response strategies. This project uses machine learning models to predict whether a fire is likely to occur based on historical and real-time data.

## Key Features

- Predicts the likelihood of a forest fire based on environmental conditions.
- Utilizes various machine learning models for classification:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Visualizes the importance of various features like temperature, wind, and humidity in fire detection.
- Provides insights for disaster management and prevention efforts.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project typically consists of features such as:
- **Temperature**: The current temperature in degrees Celsius.
- **Relative Humidity**: The percentage of air humidity.
- **Wind Speed**: Speed of wind at the time of recording.
- **Rain**: Amount of rainfall in mm.
- **Forest Area**: Total area of the forest affected or under observation.
- **Fire Occurrence**: The target variable (binary classification: fire or no fire).

### Data Preprocessing:
- **Missing data handling**: Any missing values in the dataset were imputed or removed.
- **Feature scaling**: Numerical features were scaled to standardize the input data.
- **Encoding**: Categorical variables were encoded if present.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for developing and testing the code.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For visualizing data and results.

## Model Performance

Various models were tested to predict the occurrence of forest fires, with different performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score evaluated. Below is a summary of the performance:

- **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective baseline model for binary classification.
- **Random Forest**: Tends to provide high accuracy due to its ensemble nature, making it suitable for this classification task.
- **SVM**: Performs well in high-dimensional spaces, but may require tuning of hyperparameters.

### Example Evaluation Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions (e.g., 85% accuracy).
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positive predictions to total positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Ability of the model to detect all actual fires.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall for a balanced measure.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forest-fire-detection.git
   cd forest-fire-detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Use `pip` to install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Run the notebook**:
   Open the `Forest_Fire_Detection.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook, and run the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## How to Use

1. **Preprocess the data**:
   The notebook includes steps for cleaning, encoding, and transforming the dataset into a suitable format for modeling.

2. **Train the model**:
   You can train several models using the notebook. Modify hyperparameters to improve the modelâ€™s performance.

3. **Evaluate the model**:
   Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The confusion matrix is also useful for understanding how well the model distinguishes between fire and non-fire instances.

4. **Predict new data**:
   Once the model is trained, you can load new environmental data and predict the likelihood of a forest fire.
